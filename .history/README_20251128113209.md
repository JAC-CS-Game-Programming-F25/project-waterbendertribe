# Proposal - Hunger Cats

## ✒️ Description

The game starts with 5 cats including the player in a battle royale. The goal is to be the last one standing. In the map there will be an item that allows the player to get power ups. When the player collides with the item they will be brought to a new state that implements a plinko game. A ball will bounce down a pegboard and land in a random slot, granting the player a temporary power up. The powered-up cat then warps back into the main arena, ready to turn the tide of battle. Chaos escalates until the final showdown, where the last surviving cat becomes the ultimate Hunger Cat champion. They accumulate wins per round.

## 🕹️ Gameplay
When the match begins, a countdown timer appears. As soon as it hits zero, all players and NPCs must immediately jump or run off the starting platform. Once off, players and NPCs can scatter across the arena or begin fighting right away.

NPC behavior is driven by proximity: if two NPCs come within a certain distance of each other, they will detect one another and start fighting. If the player enters an NPC’s detection range, the NPC will focus on the player instead and try to attack them.

Throughout the arena, items spawn at random. When an NPC collides with one, they receive a randomly selected temporary power-up.
Players interact with items differently. If the player collides with an item, they are transported to a separate Plinko-style bonus state. There, they drop a ball down a pegboard and whatever slot it lands in determines the temporary power-up they receive such as increased attack damage, faster movement or improved defense that reduces incoming damage. The buff lasts briefly before fading out, returning the player to normal stats.

If the player wins or looses they will be brought to a new state that will display the results as well with a play again button and their record of wins and looses.

### 🧵 Wireframes

> [!note]
> This is simply a mockup to show what we are envisioning. It's possible we may not use tileset for the plinko aspect of the game. 

![Main Map](./assets/images/main-map.png)
Every cat starts on the platform, the purple ball is meant to display the object that the player can collide with to get a power up. 

![Game Board](./assets/images/plinko-cat.png)

The cat at the top would be the ball that falls through the pins since we are going for more of a cat theme. 

### 🎨 Assets
cats:
https://oboropixel.itch.io/character-animations
https://toffeecraft.itch.io/slime-cat-mega-pack

maps:
We will be using the pokemon tileset for the map. 
For plinko and objects: 
https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/pixel-adventure-1
https://soda-1.itch.io/realistic-rpg-maker-32x32-icon-set

We used tileset to create the mockup since it already had pokemon and it was easy to display what we were thinking. 

We plan on following some gameplay logic from our previous assignments such as angry birds and pokemon.

#### ✏️ Fonts

For fonts, we will use a similar font to the one from the Hunger Games franchise. It's a font that is legible and fun to keep with the theme we're going for.

-   [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)

#### 🔊 Sounds

All sounds were taken from [freesound.org](https://freesound.org) for the actions pertaining to cards.
